            It started at exactly 1 USD on September 22, 2020 and the price of the
            token grows at 16% per year. In one year, it is expected to be $1.16,
            in two years — $1.3456, if the interest rate stays the same (it
            can be changed by GRD holders). It is a <b>stable+</b> coin.

          <p>
            Stable+ coins are programmed to follow the growing target price, they do so thanks to bonding curve mechanics, and the programs cannot be changed.

            OUSD is a familiar unit of account best suited for payments. Unlike
            USD, it can be freely and instantly moved cross-border, and the fees
            are fractions of a cent.

          <p>
            Price of GRD depends on the popularity of IUSD (and therefore OUSD). As
            more IUSD tokens are issued, the price of GRD grows programmatically — this follows from the bonding curve mechanics. When IUSD tokens
            are redeemed, GRD falls in price.
          </p>
          <p>
            GRD holders can <a href="/trade#governance">vote</a> to tune the interest rate and various parameters
            of the ecosystem that are important for keeping the peg. GRD holders
            can even vote to hire a management team tasked with promoting the use
            of OUSD — which directly affects GRD price.
          </p>
          <p>
            GRD comes from <b>gr</b>owth and <b>d</b>ollar, not from <b>gr</b>ee<b>d</b> as some might think.
