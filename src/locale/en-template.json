        "question": "IUSD constantly grows thanks to interest. Assuming this attracts new users, GRD should grow too and both token holders win, who loses then?",
        "answer": "<0>It’s not zero-sum. In the bonding curve that is used to issue the tokens, the total value of the tokens is greater than the value of the reserve that was initially invested to create them. So, yes, it is possible for each group to win in terms of the value of their assets, and not at the expense of the other group.</0>"

        "question": "Does this system run on a blockchain?",
        "answer": "<0>No. It runs on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based distributed ledger.</0><1>A blockchain would be significantly less suitable for a stablecoin like this because blockchains have blocks and miners. Miners would be able to manipulate the order of transactions within a block in order to place their own transaction before yours so that you receive a worse price when buying from a bonding curve or selling to it. Even non-miners can affect the order of transactions within a block by offering a slightly higher fee to a miner (which works like a bribe). This could expose users to significant uncertainty, risks, and losses.</1><2>Bonded stablecoins run on <1>Obyte</1> &mdash; a blockless minerless DAG ledger. In a DAG these tricks don’t work. There are no miners, no blocks, the positions of transactions in the DAG cannot be changed by anybody, and it is impossible for any single actor to manipulate the order of transactions.</2>"
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What makes stablecoins pegged to their benchmark?",
        "answer": "<0>The price of IUSD is “attracted” to the target (benchmark) with the help of a so-called capacitor.</0><1>Every purchase of IUSD or GRD from the bonding curve and every sale to the bonding curve affect the IUSD price. If a transaction pushes the price away from the target, it is “punished” with a fee, the farther away from the target, the more the fee. The collected fees get accumulated in a capacitor. Every transaction that corrects the price back to the target, is rewarded using the funds accumulated in the capacitor.</1><2>Due to the type of the bonding curve chosen, it is the holders of GRD who are the first to react to any deviations of the price from the target and correct them. For example, when too many people buy IUSD, they pull the price of IUSD below the peg (because IUSD token’s power in the curve formula is ½, i.e. less than 1, hence its partial derivative has negative power). There are two ways to correct the deviation: sell IUSD back to the curve, which is not a good idea because its price is currently below the fair price; or buy more GRD tokens. By buying more GRD tokens, traders push GRD price up (because the power in the curve formula is 2, i.e. more than 1, hence its partial derivative has positive power), therefore one who buys earlier gets a better price and traders rush to be the first to buy while the price is still below equilibrium.</2><3>Read the <1>blog article introducing bonded stablecoins</1> for more details.</3>"

In particular:</0><1><0>- bonded stablecoins do not expire any more, they are perpetual.</0><1>- OUSD is truly stable, there is no appreciation, it targets the familiar and well-established unit of account, USD.</1><2>- there are no auctions any more and users don’t need to look after their loans and refill collateral or risk losing their collateral when its price falls abruptly.</2><3>- there is no overcollateralization any more, which was commonly misunderstood.</3><4>- there is no need to balance risks against the amount of capital wasted in excess collateral.</4></1>"

        "question": "Can I trade with leverage?",
        "answer": "<0>Yes. You’ll need to create a leveraged stablecoin or use one that somebody else has already created.</0><1>A leveraged stablecoin is a synthetic coin that tracks the price of an asset to the power of 2 (for 2x leverage), 3 (for 3x leverage), -1 (for a short position), -2 (for a 2x leveraged short position), and so on.</1><2>For example, while Brent Crude is worth $40, a 2x leverage stablecoin BRENT2/USD is worth 1600. If Brent goes up 25% to $50, BRENT2/USD goes up to 2500 &mdash; a 56.25% gain.</2><3>It might seem unusual to call such coins “stablecoins” but they are stable relative to an artificial “price” such as Brent squared. Everything is relative after all, including stability.</3><4>When you <2>create a new stablecoin</2>, you need to specify the desired leverage parameter. It is 0 by default which for GBYTE/USD price feed means track USD price. Leverage 1 would mean plain long position in GBYTE (which is equivalent to just holding the reserve currency GBYTE), leverage 2 would mean 2x leveraged position in GBYTE vs USD, leverage 3 &mdash; 3x long position in GBYTE, leverage -1 &mdash; short position in GBYTE, and so on.</4><5>Note that with this kind of leverage, you can’t be margin called and liquidated.</5><6>For details, see <1>our blog introducing bonded stablecoins</1> .</6>"

The prices of GRD and IUSD, i.e. how much reserve one needs to pay per token, or can get back per token, depend on the current supplies of the tokens.</0><1>How is the peg maintained? There is a target price of IUSD which is 1 USD plus interest accrued since inception. The target price is known from GBYTE/USD price reported by an oracle that feeds data from cryptocurrency exchanges and the time elapsed since the stablecoin was launched. Whenever someone wants to buy or sell IUSD or GRD such that this transaction would push IUSD price away from the target, they have to pay a fee.
